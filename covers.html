        <p><i>Copy 'n Paste Covers</i> is a music project in which I cover a song with no original input from me (i.e. I copy what's going on in the song more-or-less exactly). The purpose of this is for me to easily practice production techniques and playing instruments in a song setting without having to exhaust my "creative juices" (not like I have much of that anyway, y'know). As this is an ongoing thing and has had quite some output over the past few months, I thought "what the heck! Let's have a page to share 'em!" and so - folks - here we are.</p>
