        <p><i>Clocking Out is for Suckers</i> - <a href="https://mega.nz/#!XWwzSIRB!yhTTY3bzqyexYXA-_UGxLgOaPMwjugRAPP1D4cJoADY">download</a><br><br>
            This was shared to the Spoon forums about 5 years ago. I'm not sure if it's still up. MP3 @ 128kbps (yikes.)</p> 
        
        <h2 style="font-size: 19px;">▦ Shotgun Jimmie</h2>
        
        <p><i>Organ Donor (Live)</i> - <a href="https://mega.nz/#!7SxhlSpI!BPVDW38-WqeIkGchPeorRAcO18Vmq8e6CPLiIFCbZQQ">download</a><br><br>
        This isn't exactly rare, and it is NOT the original recording of Organ Donor. This is a collection of audio ripped from the videos of it being performed live at - I believe - Thunder & Lightning in Sackville, downloadable here for your convenience. That's not the original artwork either, eheh, I just made it because I can't stand not having artwork in my library. MP3 @ 320kbps </p>
        
        <h2 style="font-size: 19px;">▦ Skellington</h2>

        MP3 @ 231kbps<br><br>

        <h2 style="font-size: 19px;">Things I'm looking for:</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>All the Shotgun & Jaybird releases prior to <i>There Are Days and Then There Are Days</i>.</li>
        <li>The actual Shotgun Jimmie <i>Organ Donor</i> recording would be pretty cool too. I read that it got circulated through email at one point.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>I'm also sitting on a motherlode of Hum stuff, but if you're interested in that you'll have to contact me via email to get it.</p>
