<h2>'Prayer To God' - Shellac</h2>

<p>Alright alright alriiiiighttt! First entry to the series. Here it be:</p>

<p>I like Shellac. I like Steve Albini. I also like this song, but it's not something I'd play to the family. It wasn't my intention to pick one of the edgiest things in my library, I swear. I actually picked it because I wanted something pretty simple to cover to get the series going (I need any motivation I can get, folks), and according to an interview with Albini the song...</p>

<p><i>"examines the different facets of impotent male rage. The greater point is that his presumption of a natural order, having been upended by what are after all totally normal turns of events, warrants not just death as revenge but a righteous death, administered by a loving god who agrees with his perspective..." blah blah</i></p>

<p>Sure, buddy. Whatever you say.</p>

<p>Anyway, I said simple - right? The damn thing turned out to be one of the least simple things I've ever covered (no, really!). Maybe I should've anticipated it. Hmm.</p>

<p>The hardest bit was the post-processing of the guitars. I think that's the term. Shellac has a very, er, distinct guitar tone and probably like 50% of that is down to Albini's Travis Bean guitar which has an aluminium neck or something. I can't quite remember, but that's what everyone talks about. My "irl" distortion pedal is a Boss DF2, and that thing can get meaty. However, Shellac isn't meaty.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few days and I'm getting pretty frustrated because no matter what I do, I can't get close to this tone. I exhausted every single amp, overdrive, and distortion plugin I have ever downloaded and *still* I'm sounding too average. Listening to the final recording you'll hear that I never really did capture that tone, but compared to how it started out it's some bloody progress. And you know what cut it? Reaper's built in distortion and a lot of EQ. That's something that never even crossed my mind until - tight-fisted - I came close to hitting that 'delete' button. So there ya go.</p>

<p>As for the bass, I didn't really capture the tone either, but I'm sure that would've been much easier had I not bought a bass guitar with rusty pickups for Â£40. It's very muddy as is.</p>

<p>The second hardest thing was the vocals. This isn't really a surprise seeing as I'm not exactly a great singer to start with. The vocal delivery on 'Prayer to God' is a sticky one - slightly out of tune, sorta wibbly, a lot of aggression towards the end, and makes good use of an American accent. I'm not a phoney so I try not to fake accents when I can. Also, I cannot sing aggressively. I just can't. I'm too soft spoken and girly. I took this one week "learn how to scream" vocal course thing and I came out sounding like an 8-year-old girl with a chest infection. What you hear really is my best attempt to sound like "man, I really, like, don't give a fuck whaaaaaat".</p>

<p>The drums - my least favourite drum sample library, but the only one that sounded close to those in the song. Woulda been better if I could get that snare to "snap" more, but it's not like I can physically whack MIDI. I mean, I could. But I don't. And the velocity was set to 100% for the snare anyway.</p>

<p>So - friends - that's Copy 'N' Paste Cover number ONE. I hope you liked it. Keep your eyes pickled and peeled for further entries to the series. That should definitely happen.</p>
