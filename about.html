                Hello! I'm Jess, and this is my personal site for personal things. Which is in contrast to a, er, non-personal site for non-personal things. I crafted it lovingly with my own hands. On a keyboard. <br><br>
                I'm a Lincolnshire, UK based music, art, and word-liker but I'm not a musician, artist, or writer by any stretch. Give it twenty years and I <i>might</i> qualify. For now, though, I just enjoy from a distance and do what I can when I can.<br><br>
                Things that matter to me: secularism, left-wing politics and left unity, cats, extreme weather and the sirens that go with them, and medical scanners.<br><br>
                Things that don't matter to me: Blink-182 (sorry, I could never get the hype), hot dog meat, and that's about it.<br><br>
                Computer stuff: Windows 10 for music and games, Debian (with Budgie as the DE) for everything else. AMD X4 860k + GTX 1060 6GB + 8GB RAM (but I'm moving to a laptop soon so I can live out of a suitcase... sob).<br><br>
                If there are any problems with the site in terms of accessibility or browser scaling or really anything at all, please contact me so I can make improvements (head on over to 'Links & Contact', dude).
