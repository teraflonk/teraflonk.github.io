<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 80px; padding-right: 80px;">Hello! I'm Jess (but you may know me as roadregu). I was born in Lincoln, UK, grew up in Leeds (and Northern Ireland in the summers), and I now live in Lincolnshire again (but in the middle of nowhere this time). This year I'm moving to Ontario, Canada, and I don't know how I'm going to handle the change.<br><br>
    
I love noise rock and space rock, but anything 90s underground catches my eye (ear?). In fact, music is good as a whole. Yeah! I'm a huge Hum fan (worth mentioning because they're basically a genre unto themselves for me). Sometimes I make music too! I'm a bit of an amateur though.<br><br>
    
Computer stuff: Windows 8.1 for the things that need it (games and Reaper), Manjaro Linux with i3-gaps for everything else. I use an AMD X4 860k as a CPU and a GTX 1060 6GB as a GPU. I build and repair computers as a side-project.<br><br>
    
Politics: Former ancap - now very, extremely left. And I'm right where I want to be. Anyone is welcome, though, so long as you're not a prat.<br><br>
    
Other stuff: System Shock 2 is the best, I'm agnostic atheist, a massive weather nerd, and I've been really into certain types of sirens and medical scanners for 10 years now (uuuhhhhh). Oh, and online friends are real good.
