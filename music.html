<h1 style="font-size: 20px;">Music</h1>

<p>So, I do music sometimes. This page will be a bit empty for now because not everything is released yet! (Watch this space, yeah?)</p>
            
<h2 style="font-size: 18px">Bridge Control</h2>
    
<p>Bridge Control is my solo project - rollin' since 2014. At the minute there are no official releases, except for a super-secret (and super-terrible) EP I made for a friend four years ago. BUT! There is currently a Bridge Control album nearing completion, and will see a release very soon! I may change the name (not sure yet).</p>

            <li>Bandcamp (coming soon)</li>
            </ol>

<h2 style="font-size: 18px">J. Parkins</h2>
            
<p>J. Parkins is the moniker for my side solo project. Things that don't qualify for Bridge Control (e.g. FAWM releases, songwriting challenges, covers, misc. releases, experimental stuff, etc.) will be released under this name. Bridge Control tidbits and demos may find their way here as well - particularly on the Souncloud account.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 18px">Chromar</h2>
            
<p>An online project based between Iowa, USA and Lincolnshire, UK, Chromar is an indie/pop/rock thing cultivated by myself (I play keys) and the coolest of cats - Ash. Over the years we've had some lineup changes, and presently we may have a third member joining the team ;) 'Nowt released officially (yet).</p>
